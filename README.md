# Password Generator
[https://catherinealicewood.github.io/Password-Generator/](https://catherinealicewood.github.io/Password-Generator/)
## Created as part of the Scrimba Frontend Web Dev Career Path

### Notes:
- created the blank password field on first load by having the background the same colour as the text
- initially the generate button only worked once so I tweaked the JS so that the function for generating a password was activated on the click of the button so that the button repeatedly generates new passwords
- pleased that I managed to complete the stretch goals of: - 
    - having a user input for password length
    - having a copy button
- I've learned to commit from the terminal!
### If I was to develop this further I could :
- add checkboxes for including or not including symbols and numbers
- improve the styling
